[#57] First vers. of mobile-size feed preview style
* Conditional component to more cleanly (in code) render cond'nly
* omitSpacer prop for ContentWrapper to remove horiz. spacers
* omitContentSpacer prop in PageWrapper
  * Used to pass bool into ContentWrapper
  * Same value as ContentWrapper's omitSpacer
* Add const/breaks* back into layouts/index.js
* Change breakpoints to include:
  * mobile - changed to 480
  * tablet - still 768
  * desktop - chaged to 1200
    * new name for autoMenuVisibilityBreakpoint
  * large - new @ 1280
  * xlarge - new @ 1600
* Initial work to make readable boolean breakpoint functions
  * commented out for now till time to flesh it out
* Rename breakpointReached in layout/index, it's semantically reversed
 * renamed, isMobile
* _content-wrapper.scss:
  * page-content__wrapper--mobile is the class for mobile specific styl
  * padding: 0
* new partial stylesheet: src/styles/components/_mobile-post-previews
  * currently an exact copy of _cards.scss
  * will have exact matches to _cards elements with own block selectrs
  * will be used by PostPreview component to render different previews
  when mobile breakpoints are in play.
* PostPreview
  * import 'react-media' & '.../breakpoints.js'
  * now has basic funcitons for managing breakpoint logic.
  * conditional rendering is handled by 'react-media' component
  * for now a <h1> placeholder gets rendered when mobile size
  * otherwise behaves exactly as before but with conditional render
